The files provided on this project include only the files for the labs not the source files to talk to the Kinect. 
If you would like to setup the lab yourself in a class room setting please contact nferlic@umd.edu and klawson.daniel@gmail.com
for further information and the files to run OpenCV, Nite2, and the Kinect.
